Learning To Walk
==============

A community-edited, constantly-evolving guide to moving from the "three people in a room" stage to the "a good group in an office" stage. Particularly geared towards first-time founders who have never started a business.

This is currently just a list; eventually it may be bucketed into categories.

You started a company!? High five, good work. It’s now been a few months, you’ve had a lot of late nights with your cofounders, and it’s starting to look like you are making something people want.

Here’s a heads up on some of the things you’ve probably ignored so far, but you should probably take care of. These are primarily geared to people who have never started a business.

1. It’s _illegal_ to not have Workman’s Comp. It doesn’t take a lot of effort, particularly if you get a broker to do it, but you’ll have to pay some money. Given that you legally have to, it’s a good idea.

2. Go through any code you have and make sure of two things:

   1. That any open-source components you’re using are fine for commercial use. These days, a lot of great software is being written under the MIT or Apache Licenses, but check. Twice.

   2. That there are no lines of code written by people who didn’t explicitly transfer ownership to the company (usually involves paper). It seems silly, but if someone can argue that those 10 lines they wrote when they came over for an interview resulted in 0.1% of the company’s success, you’ll kick yourself. Draft up a quick document, pay them a fair amount for the work, and keep the signature.

3. If you’re hiring people, you should have an Employee Handbook. There are legal reasons, but it’s also a good forcing function for you and your cofounders to make decisions on things you haven’t had to yet, i.e. What is your vacation policy? Are weekends off? Is swearing in the office ok? What can be expensed to the company? If you have employees agree to the handbook it can also help you not get sued for wrongful termination

4. Speaking of expensing things, don’t use cash for anything. Your (eventual) accountant will be very upset at you, and the IRS likely will as well. Best is to use a company credit card, next a company check, next a personal card/check. And always keep receipts, either digitally or in a drawer for “later”

5. Ask around about any good part-time accountants that can help you when you eventually get to “later”

6. What’s the company strategy around patents, or IP in general? Whatever you decide is fine, but you should be conscious about it. Apparently there was a startup called “Bing” that essentially failed but made quite a bit of money on the trademark.

7. Be aware that pictures and other things you write down (including emails) can be used against you for legal/tax purposes. If you’re living out of your office or visa-versa, you didn’t tell me, and you don’t have any pictures. It can be dealt with, but you’d rather not.

8. If you have investors, many times they are entitled to quarterly reports on financials, etc. Put those dates in your calendar and follow through.

As mentioned above, pull request welcome.
